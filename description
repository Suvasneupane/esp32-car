Project: ESP32 Bluetooth Controlled Car using Dabble Gamepad
Requirements / Components
1.	ESP32 Development Board (any version, e.g., ESP32 Devkit V1)
2.	L298N Motor Driver Module (to control two DC motors)
3.	Four DC Gear Motors with Wheels (2 motors for each side of the car)
4.	Battery Pack (7.4V – 12V recommended, directly connected to L298N motor supply)
5.	Jumper Wires and Breadboard (optional)
6.	Chassis (Cardboard or acrylic)
  
L298N Pin	Function	ESP32 GPIO Pin
ENA	Right Motor PWM	 D13
IN1	Right Motor Dir          	D14
IN2	Right Motor Dir	D27
ENB	Left Motor PWM	D33
IN3	Left Motor Dir	D26
IN4	Left Motor Dir	D25
  

Power Connections:
•	Connect L298N 12V pin to battery positive.
•	Connect L298N GND pin to battery negative and also to ESP32 GND (common ground is mandatory).
•	ESP32 VIN (5V) can be powered from a buck converter or USB.

Working Principle
•	The code uses the Dabble app (Gamepad module) via Bluetooth to control the car wirelessly.
•	Dabble.begin("ironman") sets the Bluetooth name as “ironman” (visible on your phone).
•	Motor speed is controlled using PWM signals (0–255 duty cycle) on ENA and ENB pins.
•	Direction control is done by toggling IN1/IN2 (right motor) and IN3/IN4 (left motor).
•	Gamepad buttons work as:
o	UP → Move forward
o	DOWN → Move backward
o	LEFT → Rotate left (right motor forward, left motor backward)
o	RIGHT → Rotate right (right motor backward, left motor forward)
